# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves upgrading the Convenient Discussions project's build stack from Webpack 4 to Webpack 5, converting CommonJS modules to ES modules, and updating dependencies to their latest versions. The upgrade aims to modernize the build system while maintaining compatibility and functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upgrade from Webpack 4 to Webpack 5, so that I can benefit from improved performance, better tree-shaking, and modern build features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN it SHALL use Webpack 5 instead of Webpack 4
2. WHEN Webpack plugins are incompatible THEN the system SHALL find suitable replacements or maintain existing functionality
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL produce the same output files as before
4. WHEN development server is started THEN it SHALL work with the new Webpack configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert CommonJS modules to ES modules in build scripts, so that the codebase uses modern JavaScript module syntax consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build scripts are executed THEN they SHALL use ES module syntax (import/export)
2. WHEN scripts in the root folder are run THEN they SHALL use ES modules instead of require()
3. WHEN scripts in misc/ folder are run THEN they SHALL use ES modules instead of require()
4. WHEN scripts in tests/ folder are run THEN they SHALL use ES modules instead of require()
5. WHEN the src/ folder is processed THEN it SHALL maintain its existing ES module usage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upgrade all dependencies to their latest versions, so that the project benefits from security updates, bug fixes, and new features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are updated THEN they SHALL be upgraded to their latest compatible versions
2. WHEN the project fails to build after updates THEN the system SHALL attempt to fix compatibility issues
3. WHEN fixes are unsuccessful THEN the system SHALL roll back problematic updates
4. WHEN all updates are complete THEN the project SHALL build and run successfully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing functionality continues to work after the upgrade.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the upgrade is complete THEN all existing npm scripts SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL produce functionally equivalent output
3. WHEN the development workflow is used THEN it SHALL work as before
4. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL pass as before the upgrade
