# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the refactoring of the Autocomplete class in the Convenient Discussions project. The current implementation uses a monolithic approach with type-based branching and scattered code for different autocomplete types (mentions, wikilinks, templates, tags, commentLinks). The refactoring will transform this into a clean object-oriented design with separate classes for each autocomplete type, eliminating code duplication and improving maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Create Type-Specific Autocomplete Classes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each autocomplete type to have its own dedicated class, so that the code is more organized and easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing autocomplete types THEN the system SHALL create separate classes for each type: MentionsAutocomplete, WikilinksAutocomplete, TemplatesAutocomplete, TagsAutocomplete, and CommentLinksAutocomplete
2. WHEN creating these classes THEN each class SHALL consolidate all logic, configuration, and state related to its specific autocomplete type
3. WHEN organizing the code THEN each class SHALL contain its own transform methods, validation logic, and API request handling
4. WHEN implementing the classes THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming conventions and structure

### Requirement 2: Establish Base Class or Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a common base class or interface for autocomplete types, so that shared functionality is reused and the API is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the type classes THEN the system SHALL provide a base class or interface that defines the common contract
2. WHEN implementing shared functionality THEN the base class SHALL contain common methods for caching, query handling, and result processing
3. WHEN defining the interface THEN it SHALL specify required methods like getCollection(), transform(), and validateInput()
4. WHEN using polymorphism THEN the system SHALL eliminate type-based branching in favor of method overrides

### Requirement 3: Consolidate Configuration and State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation between configuration and state, so that the code is easier to understand and debug.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing class structure THEN configuration SHALL be separated from dynamic state
2. WHEN managing state THEN each autocomplete type class SHALL handle its own cache, lastResults, and lastQuery properties
3. WHEN defining configuration THEN static configuration SHALL be clearly distinguished from instance-specific settings
4. WHEN accessing configuration THEN the system SHALL provide clear methods to retrieve type-specific settings

### Requirement 4: Eliminate Code Duplication

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove duplicated code in the values() methods, so that maintenance is easier and bugs are reduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing values() methods THEN common patterns SHALL be extracted to the base class
2. WHEN handling API requests THEN shared request logic SHALL be consolidated into reusable methods
3. WHEN processing results THEN common result processing SHALL be moved to base class methods
4. WHEN validating input THEN shared validation logic SHALL be extracted to avoid duplication

### Requirement 5: Maintain Tribute Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored code to work seamlessly with the existing Tribute library, so that no changes are needed to the Tribute classes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring THEN the system SHALL NOT modify any classes in the src/tribute/ directory
2. WHEN integrating with Tribute THEN the new classes SHALL provide collections in the expected format
3. WHEN using Tribute methods THEN the interface SHALL remain compatible with existing Tribute expectations
4. WHEN handling callbacks THEN the system SHALL maintain the same callback signatures and behavior

### Requirement 6: Update External References

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all external references to the Autocomplete class to work correctly after refactoring, so that the system continues to function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN all imports and references to Autocomplete SHALL be updated as needed
2. WHEN the API changes THEN external code SHALL be updated to use the new interface
3. WHEN testing THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work as before
4. WHEN using the autocomplete THEN the public interface SHALL remain backward compatible where possible

### Requirement 7: Improve Method Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-structured methods with clear responsibilities, so that the code is easier to read and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing methods THEN each method SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
2. WHEN implementing long procedures THEN they SHALL be broken down into smaller, focused methods
3. WHEN naming methods THEN names SHALL clearly indicate their purpose and scope
4. WHEN structuring classes THEN public and private methods SHALL be clearly distinguished
5. WHEN adding method overrides THEN the overriding methods SHALL be marked with the @override annotation

### Requirement 8: Preserve Existing Functionality

**User Story:** As a user of the Convenient Discussions tool, I want all autocomplete features to continue working exactly as before, so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mentions autocomplete THEN it SHALL work identically to the current implementation
2. WHEN using wikilinks autocomplete THEN it SHALL provide the same suggestions and behavior
3. WHEN using templates autocomplete THEN template data insertion SHALL work as before
4. WHEN using tags and comment links autocomplete THEN all existing features SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN switching between autocomplete types THEN the user experience SHALL remain unchanged
